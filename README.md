This is a sample app using Redux and React. It is created as an example on how to the [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) work and how you can integrate them into your app to speed up development.

You can check out the demo [here](http://argelius.github.io/react-redux-timetravel/)
